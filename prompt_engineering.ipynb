      "Recursion is a programming technique whereby a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. Recursive functions typically have two main components: a base case, which stops the recursion, and the recursive case, which continues to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Simple Example: Factorial Calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "A classic example of recursion is the calculation of a factorial, which is defined as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \\( n! = n \\times (n-1)! \\) for \\( n > 0 \\)\n",
      "- \\( 0! = 1 \\) (base case)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you can implement the factorial calculation in Python using recursion:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def factorial(n):\n",
      "    # Base case: if n is 0, return 1\n",
      "    if n == 0:\n",
      "        return 1\n",
      "    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n",
      "    else:\n",
      "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage\n",
      "number = 5\n",
      "result = factorial(number)\n",
      "print(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}.\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation of the Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Base Case**: The function checks if `n` is `0`. If true, it returns `1`. This stops further recursive calls.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than `0`, it calculates the factorial by multiplying `n` by the result of `factorial(n - 1)`. This will trigger the function to call itself with a decremented value until it reaches the base case.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Flow for `factorial(5)`:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `factorial(5)` → returns `5 * factorial(4)`\n",
      "2. `factorial(4)` → returns `4 * factorial(3)`\n",
      "3. `factorial(3)` → returns `3 * factorial(2)`\n",
      "4. `factorial(2)` → returns `2 * factorial(1)`\n",
      "5. `factorial(1)` → returns `1 * factorial(0)`\n",
      "6. `factorial(0)` → returns `1` (base case reached)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the computation unwinds:\n",
      "\n",
      "- `factorial(1)` returns `1`\n",
      "- `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`\n",
      "- `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`\n",
      "- `factorial(4)` returns `4 * 6 = 24`\n",
      "- `factorial(5)` returns `5 * 24 = 120`\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, `factorial(5)` results in `120`. This example clearly demonstrates how recursion works to break down a problem into smaller instances of the same problem until a base case is reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Puri Jagannath Temple, located in Puri, Odisha, India, is one of the most significant and revered Hindu temples in the country. Its importance can be understood from several perspectives: religious, cultural, historical, and architectural.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Religious Significance\n",
      "1. **Deity Worship**: The temple is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, an avatar of Lord Vishnu, who is worshipped along with his siblings, Balabhadra and Subhadra. The form of Jagannath is unique, characterized by a stylized deity with large, round eyes and a simplistic form, which differs from the more traditional iconography seen in other Hindu temples.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pilgrimage Site**: Puri is one of the four Char Dham pilgrimage sites in Hinduism (along with Badrinath, Dwarka, and Rameswaram). Hindus believe that visiting these sites can liberate the soul, making Puri a focal point for spiritual pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Rath Yatra**: The annual Rath Yatra (Chariot Festival) is a major event that attracts millions of devotees and tourists. Devotees pull large wooden chariots bearing the deities through the streets of Puri, symbolizing the journey of the deities from the temple to their garden abode (Gundicha Ghar) and back. This festival represents community, devotion, and the idea of divine presence among the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cultural Significance\n",
      "1. **Integration of Traditions**: The temple is a melting pot of various cultural and religious practices, blending elements of tribal and folk traditions with mainstream Hindu beliefs. The rituals, dances, and offerings reflect the diverse cultural tapestry of Odisha.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Arts and Crafts**: The temple has inspired numerous artistic expressions, from traditional Odissi dance to handicrafts and paintings. Its rituals and ceremonies are accompanied by music and dance, enriching the cultural heritage of the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Historical Significance\n",
      "1. **Ancient Origins**: The temple's roots trace back to the 12th century, with some beliefs suggesting even earlier origins. It has witnessed various historical events, including dynasties that patronized it, such as the Ganga dynasty. Over the centuries, it has served as a site for religious, political, and social activities, contributing to the historical narrative of the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Survival and Resilience**: The temple has survived numerous challenges, including invasions and natural disasters. Its endurance reflects the strong faith of its devotees and the importance of the temple in the social and political landscape of Odisha.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Architectural Significance\n",
      "1. **Kalinga Architecture**: The temple is an excellent example of Kalinga architecture, featuring intricate carvings, large stone structures, and a distinctive spire (shikhara). The design includes elements that are significant in understanding ancient Indian architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Layout**: The temple complex is vast, comprising various shrines, halls, and courtyards, each serving different functions in the temple's daily rituals. The layout and craftsmanship not only serve religious purposes but also demonstrate advanced architectural techniques of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the Puri Jagannath Temple is significant as a religious nucleus for millions, a cultural landmark, an architectural marvel, and a historical beacon that continues to influence the lives of people today. It encapsulates the essence of devotion, tradition, and community in Hindu culture, making it an enduring symbol of faith and heritage in India.\n",

      "2. **Determine how many apples you eat:** You eat 2 apples.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **State the final amount:** After eating 2 apples, you have 3 apples remaining.\n",

Ultimately, it advocates for the pursuit of spiritual knowledge and the realization of one's true self.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure! Here are three key points about the Bhagavad Gita:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Philosophical Dialogue**: The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that takes the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. The conversation occurs on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where Arjuna is conflicted about fighting in a war against his own relatives and mentors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dharma and Duty**: A central theme of the Gita is the concept of 'dharma' (duty/righteousness). Krishna teaches Arjuna about the importance of performing one's duty without attachment to the results. He emphasizes that fulfilling one's responsibilities is crucial, even in the face of difficult moral dilemmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Paths to Spiritual Realization**: The text outlines various paths to spiritual growth, including the path of devotion (bhakti), knowledge (jnana), and disciplined action (karma). It presents the idea that individuals can attain liberation (moksha) by following these paths and recognizing their connection to the divine.\n",
